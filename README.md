# Smart AT&T Global Network Client

This tries to create a seamless VPN connection between you and your enterprise.
It consists of tray icon and tries to keep you connected whenever possible.

## Prerequisites

Having the normal AT&T Global Network Client is enough. Actually, you only need
to have the `agnclientd` and `agnLogd` services running and they are already
there if you have a working VPN connection on you PC.

## Installation

Extract into any folder and compile if necessary. It is useful to add it to the
"Startup Applications" list.

## Disclaimer

I'm no C programmer, so collaborations will be greatly appreciated.
